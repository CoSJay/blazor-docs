# Track Changes in Blazor DocumentEditor Component

Track Changes allows you to keep a record of changes or edits made to a document. You can then choose to accept or reject the modifications. It is a useful tool for managing changes made by several reviewers to the same document. If track changes option is enabled, all editing operations are preserved as revisions in Document Editor.

## Enable track changes in Document Editor

The following example demonstrates how to enable track changes.

```csharp
<SfDocumentEditorContainer ID="cont" @ref="container" EnableTrackChanges="true" EnableToolbar="true">
</SfDocumentEditorContainer>
```

## Navigate between the tracked changes

The following example demonstrates how to navigate tracked revision programmatically.

```csharp
/**
 * Navigate to next tracked change from the current selection.
 */
container.DocumentEditor.Selection.NavigateNextRevisionAsync();

/**
 * Navigate to previous tracked change from the current selection.
 */
container.DocumentEditor.Selection.NavigatePreviousRevisionAsync();
```

## Filtering changes based on user

In DocumentEditor, we have built-in review panel in which we have provided support for filtering changes based on the user.
